## 👋 Hello World — I’m Harsh Srivastava

Welcome to my cybersecurity research blog.

I’m a Security Researcher with a primary focus on **IoT, OT (Operational Technology), and Application Security**. This blog is my personal space to document hands-on penetration testing, vulnerability research, lab experiments, and real-world security learnings.

### 🔍 What I Do

My work revolves around identifying, analyzing, and understanding security weaknesses across:

* IoT devices and embedded systems
* Industrial/OT environments
* Web and application infrastructures
* Network and communication protocols

I approach security with an offensive mindset — thinking like an attacker to help build stronger defenses.

### 🧪 Why This Blog Exists

While learning and working in cybersecurity, I realized that documenting practical knowledge is just as important as gaining it.

Through this platform, I aim to share:

* Exploitation techniques
* Research notes from IoT & OT and Applications security testing
* Vulnerability discovery and analysis
* Security tools and methodologies
* Pentesting lab walkthroughs 

This blog serves as both my knowledge archive and a resource for others in the security community.

### 🚀 My Goal

To continuously explore modern and industrial attack surfaces, contribute to the security ecosystem, and grow as a well-rounded offensive security professional.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect

If you’re passionate about cybersecurity, IoT/OT security, or penetration testing, feel free to follow my work and connect with me through this blog.

Thanks for stopping by — more research and lab write-ups coming soon.
